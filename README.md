Welcome to Cognition!

Cognition is an open source database processing pipeline. Its purpose is to convert common document formats into a common representation, and modify them in a customisable manner. Its primary use case is to facilitate electronic health record (EHR) informatics research by converting documents into a common format, and masking strong patient identifiers according to a customisable, regular expression based algorithm.
